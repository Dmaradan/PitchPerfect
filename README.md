# PitchPerfect
The first iOS application I made for Udacity's Nanodegree program

This application records an audio clip and uses the AVAudioEngine class to change the pitch or speed
of the recording before playing it back.

Different playback options include decreased speed, increased speed, decreased pitch (Darth Vader), 
and increased pitch (Chipmunk).

The application was originally named PressPlay, which is why some of the folders are named that way.
